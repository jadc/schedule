# schedule
The most advanced website I've ever made: A schedule.

# What?
I made this website to inform me which block I had in my school to go to. The site is very dynamic, vastly changing it's layout depending on the time. For instance, it will highlight which block I was currently in depending on the time.

Obviously this site has no purpose anymore due to me having a schedule more advanced than a ninth grader, but it serves as a good benchmark of my skill.
